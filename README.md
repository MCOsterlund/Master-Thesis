Programs and litterature for my Master's thesis

This repository serves as a backup of the files I have needed throughout my time writing my thesis. This includes scripts, generated figures, and litterature I have found.

Please note that not all of the articles in the "Litterature" folder has been relevant for the thesis. All the work that is relevant should be cited in the thesis.
